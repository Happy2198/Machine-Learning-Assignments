# Assignment 1: Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression

Steps to run:
1. CD into the folder where files are present.
2. Run command "python gnb.py" for running Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm with accuracy vs training set size learning curve. By running this command, mean and variance comparison of newly generated samples will also be demonstrated.
3. Run command "python log_reg.py" for running both Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms with graphs and combined graph.
