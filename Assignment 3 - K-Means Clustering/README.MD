###### Steps to run:
    1. CD into the folder where files are present.
    2. Run command "python k-means.py" for running K-Means algorithm with Potential function vs value of K learning curve.

###### Output:
K =  2  F_mu_c:  19782.7298042

K =  3  F_mu_c:  18534.9285261

K =  4  F_mu_c:  15574.1262074

K =  5  F_mu_c:  14032.4176743

K =  6  F_mu_c:  13197.2165484

K =  7  F_mu_c:  13157.758159

K =  8  F_mu_c:  12997.9737375
