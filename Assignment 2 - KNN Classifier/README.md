# Assignment 2: K Nearest Neighbor Classifier

#### KNN classifier implemented on the famous MNIST data set where each example is a hand written digit.

###### Steps to run:
    1. CD into the folder where files are present.
    2. Make sure the dataset files "mnist_test.csv" and "mnist_train.csv" are present in this folder.
    3. Run command "python knn.py" for running KNN algorithm with error vs value of K learning curve.

###### Output:
    K =  1  Test set error:  [ 0.049]

    K =  9  Test set error:  [ 0.061]

    K =  19  Test set error:  [ 0.067]

    K =  29  Test set error:  [ 0.073]

    K =  39  Test set error:  [ 0.082]

    K =  49  Test set error:  [ 0.086]

    K =  59  Test set error:  [ 0.096]

    K =  69  Test set error:  [ 0.103]

    K =  79  Test set error:  [ 0.109]

    K =  89  Test set error:  [ 0.115]

    K =  99  Test set error:  [ 0.118]
